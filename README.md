# CS-350

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

For Milestone Two, I was instructed to build a state machine to control an LED to turn on or
off depending on if the user typed the word ON or OFF. The problem this was solving was being
able to let people know if an LED was working properly or not.

For Project One, I was instructed to build a prototype thermostat that could potentially be used
in the field so users could control whether the heating system would be turned on or off depending
on if the ambient temperature of the room was warmer or colder than the set temperature. This was
solving the concern of someone not having a newer thermostat that would be cheaper than most modern
thermostats.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I did better with the thermostat than I did with the LED control since I learned how to control the
LEDs better between Project One and Milestone Two.

**Where could you improve?**

One area I could use the most improvement is time management. I was always procrastinating how much
time I had and when it came to the last minute, I was always rushing to try and finish everything.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**

I am going to keep using TI CCS while learning more about embedded systems on the off chance that I
make a career with embedded systems to ensure I stay up-to-date with the newest syntax.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**

The biggest skill that will be able to transfer to other courses or projects is the ability to code
in C due to the syntax being similar to many other languages which will help with many different classes.

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

The way I kept the project maintanable, readable, and adaptable is by including the code to check which
temperature sensor is being used, while also including comments above each class to ensure that people
can read what the class does to make sure it is runnable for anyone to use.
